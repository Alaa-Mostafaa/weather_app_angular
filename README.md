SkyCast app 

This application is interested in displaying the weather conditions for any country.

First: The user's location is known through the geo location and all weather conditions for this place are displayed automatically.

This information includes:
Displaying the current day's temperatures and weather conditions from cloud percentage, wind direction, wind speed and wind angle.

Displaying temperatures for every hour of the day (24 hours).

Displaying icons to clarify the weather conditions.

Displaying 5 days after the current day.

The user can search for any city he wants to see the weather for and all the previous information will appear.

If the user enters a city that does not exist or an incorrect name, a message will appear stating that the city name is incorrect and that a valid city name must be entered.
